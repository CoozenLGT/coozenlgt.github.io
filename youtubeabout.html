        <h2>About CoozenLGT's YouTube</h2>
        <p>I started YouTube in Late 2023, in about November 2023. The name 'CoozenLGT' was made up by me.</p>
        <p>The channel name idea was first 'ChosenLGT' but changed to 'CoozenLGT' as it was random.</p>
        <p>I came up with the name 'CoozenLGT' for Chosen and guess what? I took away the 'h' added an extra 'o' and replaced 's' with a Z!</p>

        <h2>My Old Channels</h2>
        <p>When youtube were a new thing, I really wanted to have a go... So I made my very first YouTube Channel 'KayDPlayz' It was originally going to be called KDPlayz, but I switched to KayDPlayz. 'Kay' meaning my second name, (this is not my second name!) and 'D' meaning my first name and 'Playz' as a usual type of channel names!</p>
        <p>Then my second channel was 'Chezzo' where I'd make POV's and well lets not go to detail on what I made because they were really cringe, like a 5yr watching cocomelon! I came up with the name 'Chezzo' because, well.. I really like cheese!</p>
        <p>This is the last channel I made before I moved on to this channel! It was called 'Chosen Kookie'. Yep, with a 'Chosen' believe or not! I came up with this name because, like the last one... I also like cookies? Anyway.. Believe or not this channel is still around! You can visit it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@chosenkookie">here</a></p>
